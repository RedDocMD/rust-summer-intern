# Deadlock detection in Rust

This repo links to the code I have written for my Rust summer intern:

- [Undertaker](https://github.com/RedDocMD/undertaker), a POC tool to detect deadlocks statically in Rust programs
- [Ratmole](https://github.com/RedDocMD/ratmole), a POC supporting tool to statically perform name-resolution within a Rust crate and its dependencies.
